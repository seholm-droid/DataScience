    "There are some uneccesary columns like the Unnamed: 0. For simple explorative analysis we'd just keep it to avoid obsufucation of the code, but for this excercise we'll remove them, to show we can. Pandas was used because it's well-known, easy-to-use Python module which have been (more or less) optimised for work on large amounts of data. Therefore it is easy to get help on Stack Overflow and you quickly get a sense of how to use it correctly. 66 observations of the column content in our dataset are missing out of 1,000,000 observations. It is a very small percentage, so we remove these and expect there to be very little to no loss of information, when we train our model. A dataset containing 1,000,000 is relatively big and it is memory intensive on our laptops to process. After the initial cleaning of the dataset we saved it as a csv-file which is relatively big, but we need it to treat the dataset in chunks for text processing. We saved the treated chunks in a memory-efficient file format parquet to combine them in the end. Treating data in chunks require that we little to no dependence between chunks, which is the case here."

    "There are 12 different categories for classifications of articles. Political, unreliable, bias, fake, conspiracy, unknown, rumor, clickbait, junksci, satire, reliable and hate.\n",
    "Out of total 999,934 articles classified in these categories around 30.1% are classified as political. Only 0.7% of articles are actually classified as reliable. 14.8% are classified as unreliable and 12.9% directly as fake. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observation 2: We check the classifications of different sites to see how they are classifed\n",
    "It seems that the sites fall under one category i.e. no site have more than one classification. This is unexpected, as we would think a site could fall in multiple categories. This result might be a result from how the article was classified in the first place. It seems like the classification might have been done on a domain level. Which means articles from specific sites might have automatically been deemed to be e.g. unreliable even if they are not. Reading the documentation for the news data on GitHub, our hypothesis of automatic classification on source level and not article level seems to be correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observation 3: We check to see if there is a correlation between type classifications and author anonymity\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only 15.4% of the reliable articles in our dataset that has an author. This is very surprising as we would expect the reliable articles to have a high degree of authors. Looking at the dataset it seems like christianpost.com in particular is missing authors and visiting the site we can actually see authors on the articles so the low percentage of reliable articles with author is caused by christianpost.com (and some by nutritionfacts.org). This is a little worrying as a model fitted on the data could to a higher degree classify articles without authors as reliable even if this is against our intuition. In accordance with out intuition we do still see that the number of authors on unreliable articles are lower than on reliable articles. Interestingly the fake articles have 68.1% of articles with an author. Acoording to our dataset an article is more likely to be fake if the article has an author listed. Maybe this is due to the fact that our dataset is still relatively small (compared to the full dataset), or maybe the writers of fake articles uses an alias to make it more believable that the article is not fake."

For the date the article was published, we just use the date format in the articles, but for the scraped at variable we try to be a little more adventurous and use unix time i.e. seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1. january 1970. This makes it possible to represent time as an integer in e.g. a database. Furthermore it is a way to standardise time so we don't have to regard time zones."

The poll results showed support for the Labour Party was also rising.\\n A poll by Panelbase yesterday showed Labour six points ahead; a similar survey by Survation for the Daily Mirror showed Labour four points ahead of the Conservatives. This latter poll was mixed for the Labour leader as it showed only 25% of voters were convinced Miliband was suited to the job of Prime Minister while 37% preferred David Cameron, but it also shows that people preferred Miliband\\'s recent conduct as party leader to Cameron\\'s. A poll by TNS found a three point lead for Labour.\\n ComRes polling indicated the eventual outcome of the election is too close to call, projecting the Conservatives with 34% of the vote and Labour 33%.\\n Following the poll results, the Conservative Party fired a volley of negative remarks towards Labour.

National security is too important to play politics with and I will never compromise national security.\"\\n Former Labour leader Tony Blair said Fallon\\'s remarks hinted at desperation: \"The Tories were up to their old tricks in their personal attack on Ed this morning. I remember the \\'demon eyes\\' poster of 1997. It is always a sign of desperation and it will backfire. It shows how nervous they are of a Labour campaign full of confidence, which is showing that it understands the challenges facing working people and how to overcome them.

Labour\\'s Yvette Cooper is to formally announce a new policy today to protect 10,000 police officers\\' jobs by eliminating elected Police and Crime Commissioners and gun licensing subsidy, and sharing of police back-office services and procurement. The Labour crime and justice manifesto also includes creating a new commission on sexual and domestic violence, banning \"legal highs\", and reforming prisons to introduce more education and work for prisoners.\\n Conservative Cameron pre-announced a proposal to change the rules so workers in the public sector and for companies with 250 employees or more — which between the two is estimated to be around half the work force — would be entitled to three days of paid volunteering leave per year.

Inspired by her comments and enthusiasm from audiences, he observed \"If it\\'s beautifying they want, it\\'s beautifying they\\'ll get.\"  Recognizing that \"ours is an automobile society,\" the President did not want to curtail roads. He wanted to make roads the \"highways to the enjoyment of nature and beauty.\" Lady Bird thought that her love of seeing Texas highways in spring had influenced her husband. She enjoyed the results of Texan wildflower conservation programs which began in the 1930s.\\n One of the most prominent results of the President\\'s beauty initiative was the Highway Beautification Act of 1965. It created restrictions on billboards and junkyards. As expected, it had been controversial. When the House considered its version of the bill on October 7, the debate lasted into the early morning hours of October 8. A pointed but tongue-in-cheek amendment by Representative Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to strike out the term \"Secretary of Commerce\" wherever it appeared in the bill and insert the words \"Lady Bird\" lost by a voice vote. Saying, \"Beauty belongs to all the people,\" the President signed the bill and gave the first pen to Lady Bird, along with a kiss on the cheek.\\n In 1982, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center to continue the mission of changing public attitudes toward native plants.  In 1997 it was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.\\n', 'type': 'reliable', 'domain': 'https://en.wikinews.org/', 'url': 'https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Lady_Bird_Johnson_released_from_Austin_hospital', 'title': 'Lady Bird Johnson released from Austin hospital'}\n",

They also held a press conference declaring their freedom.\\n \"We are no longer citizens of the United States of America and all those who live in the five-state area that encompasses our country are free to join us. This is according to the laws of the United States, specifically article six of the constitution,\" said Means during the press conference.\\n Since then, Russell Means has gone on to announce the formation of a \"provisional government\" of the \"Republic of Lakotah\" with himself as Chief Facilitator, as well as to promote the establishment of a bank and a utility company for the country. Despite the claim Means has made, Naomi Archer, liaison of Lakotah Oyate stated to Wikinews that Means took control of the organization and hijacked it and its website on December 29. Archer also said that Lakotah Oyate or the delegation are not a government entity and do not make decisions for the Nation.\\n \"The legitimate actions of the Lakota people are not determined by one person [Russell Means] or even one group, but by the [Lakota] people themselves,\" added Archer. \\n Other signers of the withdrawal letter are all still involved in the movement, including Canupa Gluha Mani who heads the Strong Heart Warrior Society which will \"probably become the paramilitary force\" of Lakotah, said Archer. Wikinews asked Archer if Means would still be involved in the movement, but she refused to comment.\\n The Bank of Lakotah and Provisional Government of Lakota are not supported by Lakotah Oyate; Means is acting without having consulted the other elders of Lakotah; Means is himself, at age 69 [sic], an elder, and \"people need their elders to set better examples than that,\" said Archer.\\n While the idea of establishing a power company, bank, and other such institutions was an idea that had come from Means and the rest of Lakotah Freedom Delegation knew that he was going off to Washington D.C. on his own to conduct negotiations, they did not know what the negotiations were going to be regarding. Lakotah Oyate hopes that this dispute will be resolved in a few weeks because this \"all has to be about the people\".\\n Since the Delegation\\'s press conference, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Reservation have rejected Means\\'s and the delegation\\'s declaration of secession.\\n \"They\\'re individuals acting on their own. They did not come to the Rosebud Sioux tribal council or our government in any way to get our support and we do not support what they\\'ve done. We do not support what Means and his group are doing and they don\\'t have any support from any tribal government I know of. They don\\'t speak for us,\" said Rosebud Sioux Tribe president, Rodney Bordeaux.\\n Despite those rejections, Archer said that the Pine Ridge Reservation\\'s council may \"consider the proposal.\" A representative for the Standing Rock Reservation\\'s council has said that that reservation is also considering Lakotah Oyate\\'s proposal.

Although president-elect Donald Trump has called for a \"repeal and replace\" plan, saying that a new health care system would be enacted \"almost simultaneously,\" many in government and the press have expressed doubts about whether this would actually happen.\\n Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she would like to at least see a well-constructed plan before voting and Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia said repealing Obamacare without replacing it was \"unacceptable.\" These concerns were shared by members of the House of Representatives. \"We need to be voting for a replacement plan at the same time that we vote for repeal,\" added Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey agreed, saying, \"We\\'re loading a gun here. I want to know where it\\'s pointed before we start the process.\" \\n Anna Merlan of Jezebel and Anthony Taylor of the Associated Press dismiss Trump\\'s timeline as \"impossible\" given the complicated nature of U.S. congressional workings. Senator Collins agreed, saying \"I don\\'t see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month. I just don\\'t see that as being feasible.\"\\n The Affordable Care Act, which is often cited as a key accomplishment of the Obama administration, has had a mixed reputation, and many conservatives believe a market-based health care system would be more flexible and efficient and less costly, and many believe that the Affordable Care Act only passed because of Obama\\'s later discredited pledge that no one who liked their current health plan would have to switch. Matt O\\'Brien of The Washington Post claims a large tax cut that would result for the wealthiest 1% of citizens if Obamacare funds were not converted to other purposes, estimated at about $32,820 annually per person by the Tax Policy Center, is also a significant motive.\\n Republican Senators set a date of January 27 to repeal Obamacare, according to NBC News. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California says legislation repealing Obamacare and replacing it could ready by late February.  According to Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, as many as 30 million people could lose their health insurance if the ACA is repealed.\\n \"US House of Representatives passes universal health care bill\" — Wikinews, November 8, 2009\\n', 'type': 'reliable', 'domain': 'https://en.wikinews.org/', 'url': 'https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Late-night_vote_sets_Obamacare_up_for_filibuster-free_repeal', 'title': 'Late-night vote sets Obamacare up for filibuster-free repeal'}\n",

El Pais, one of five mainstream papers partnering with Wikileaks\\' release of documents, examined key output from Madrid\\'s US embassy.\\n The latest cables focus on US–Spain relations, particularly during the George W. Bush presidency, with Eduardo Aguirre serving as ambassador in Madrid. He is cited as having \"personally exerted\" pressure on Spain\\'s government and judiciary; this leading to at least three investigations being dropped.\\n Of concern to the press is the death of José Couso in 2003. The Spanish cameraman was killed during the battle for Baghdad; the Spanish judiciary intended to prosecute three US servicemen over the fatality.\\n American use of Spanish air bases for \\'extraordinary rendition\\' was a second concern the US embassy in Madrid pressured the government on. Spanish prosecutors had been keen to pursue 13 CIA officers over the illegal flights.\\n Repeatedly, concern over Spain\\'s independent judiciary invoking \\'universal jurisdiction\\' appears in leaked cables. Reports at the time showed magistrates considered actions at Guantanamo Bay torture, and seemed keen to pursue ex-US government officials on grounds of \"criminal responsibility\".\\n Cable 06MADRID1914 highlights the cases of Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed and Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien; respectively transferred from Guantanamo Bay, to Spanish custody, in February 2004 and July 2005.\\n Describing conditions at the Cuban detention centre as \"impossible to explain, much less justify\", Hamed — better known as the \"Spanish Taliban\" — saw a July 2006 ruling by the country\\'s Supreme Court annul his six-year prison sentence, granting him an immediate release. The ruling cast doubt on the reliability of evidence against Lahcen, who was released on bail.\\n Hamed and his family, at the time, announced their intent to sue the US government over his suffering in Guantanamo Bay.\\n Later cables illustrate how concerned the Bush administration were over possible prosecution by Baltasar Garzón. Citing an op-ed he penned for a Spanish paper in March 2007, and this subsequently being picked up by Socialist Party secretary José Blanco Lopéz. Pronouncements by the two, and others, on \"criminal responsibility\" were met with a diplomatically stern response; cable 07MADRID546 states that the government of Spain was \"cautioned that continued statements on this issue by senior Spanish figures would be viewed negatively.\"\\n Garzón, best-known for indicting former dictator Augusto Pinochet, seemed to still trouble US diplomats when planning high-level defence talks in March 2007. Mention is made to a possible investigation, and indictment of, Donald Rumsfeld. Spain had informed the US embassy in Madrid the judge in the case was working to dismiss it.\\n As recently as March last year, Garzón sought to prosecute officials from the Bush administration.\\n Named as potential defendants in a Reuters report, John Ashcroft, John Yoo, William Haynes II, Jay Bybee, and, aide to Vice-President Dick Cheney, David Addington were all being investigated by Garzón.\\n Come April this year, Garzón himself faced prosecution. A probe into Franco-era war crimes saw him suspended, possibly to be tried for acting contrary to an amnesty extended to Franco supporters. It is alleged he \"acted without jurisdiction\".\\n At present, the former Spanish Supreme Court judge is working at the International Criminal Court. Reports based on El Pais\\' investigation around the leaked cables suggest the country\\'s judiciary has been politicised to suit American interests.\\n With a price of US$85,000 cited for each former Guantanamo Bay detainee that Spain was to take, recent reports assert other countries have been offered financial incentives to help empty the camp.\\n Belgium, alongside Spain, was supposedly offered more influence within the European Union in exchange for cooperating with US plans.\\n Kuwait\\'s interior minister is said to have refused to take any of their citizens from the camp. Describing inmates as \"rotten\", DPA alleges he told the US to \"get rid of\" detainees in an Afghan war zone.\\n Yemen, in exchange for agreeing to take Guantanamo detainees, is said to have asked for US$11 million for the construction of a centre to rehabilitate Muslim extremists.\\n So far, only a tiny fraction of the documents in Wikileaks possession have been made public.\\n', 'type': 'reliable', 'domain': 'https://en.wikinews.org/', 'url': 'https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Latest_%27CableGate%27_disclosures_hint_at_US_diplomatic_tactics_in_Spain_and_beyond', 'title': \"Latest 'CableGate' disclosures hint at US diplomatic tactics in Spain and beyond\"}\n",

The Victorian government\\'s COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed \"this individual travelled to a funeral in Melbourne\", and no other people within the person\\'s household are at risk. \\n The case - which is Latrobe City\\'s first active case since January 12 - is one of 92 community transmission cases recorded on Sunday in Victoria. There are currently two COVID-19 testing sites in Latrobe City - one at The Healthcare Centre at 185-189 Princes Drive in Morwell, the other at Australian Clinical Labs at 10-12 Grey Street in Traralgon.\\n A drive-through testing site began operating at 12PM on Sunday, which is located at Dorevitch Pathology in Latrobe Regional Hospital. A pop-up testing site has also been established at the Gippsland Regional Indoor Sports Stadium. Both sites are located in Traralgon.\\n Concerning COVID-19 testing, Latrobe City mayor Sharon Gibson told Wikinews via email \"I would like to see support from the Government for further Testing Stations to be opened across our City and additional Vaccination doses made available, so that anybody wanting to be vaccinated is able to do so as quickly as possible. We are willing to work with the relevant Agencies to ensure this can be rolled out ASAP.\"\\n Independent state MP for Morwell Russell Northe called for more government support in testing Latrobe City residents. Through email, Northe told Wikinews \"I have called upon the State Government to increase the number of testing options for our community given the current demand. Unfortunately despite the best efforts of testers many locals have been turned away from being tested [on Sunday] which understandably has left quite a few residents feeling upset and anxious.\"\\n On Sunday, two COVID-19 exposure sites were recorded in Traralgon, both located at the Traralgon Centre Plaza. One was the Coles supermarket, exposed on August 22 between 11:45AM and 12:05PM, and the other is the food court, exposed on August 27 between 11:10AM and 11:15AM.\\n Two more exposure incidents were added yesterday - an additional exposure at the above food court between 12:25PM and 2:45PM on August 22, and an exposure at the Traralgon Woolworths on Seymour Street on August 23 between 5:20PM and 5:45PM. Anyone who visited these sites has been urgently advised to receive a COVID-19 test and self-isolate until they receive their results.\\n In regards to the earlier announcement of exposure sites, Sharon Gibson called upon people who had visited them or had symptoms to get tested. She said \"I would urge people to be tested if they were anywhere near the Exposure Sites and if they have any symptoms at all, please go and get tested. Now it is especially important to follow the public health advice.\" Gibson added \"I would hope the person who has tested positive recovers quickly. As this is the last thing they need, considering they were at a funeral and would be grieving.\"\\n National Party federal MP for Gippsland Darren Chester spoke to Wikinews via email, stating \"with [Sunday]\\'s news of a positive case in Traralgon, it’s important to follow the public health advice, particularly around checking in, physical distancing and hand hygiene.

I encourage everyone who is eligible for vaccination to make a booking and get the jab, to protect you, your family, and the wider community.\"\\n Russell Northe expressed his hope the circumstances would be handled well in regards to the exposure sites. He wrote \"there are a number of local exposure sites which have been announced and hopefully health authorities and contact tracers are able to get on top of the situation prior to it becoming a major issue like we have seen in other communities such as Shepparton.\" The City of Greater Shepparton recorded nine COVID-19 cases on Sunday, adding to a total of 92 active cases in the area.\\n Northe also stated \"many community members were shocked to learn on Sunday of an active COVID case in the region. The Latrobe Valley has been without COVID for many months and people are drained and tired by the continuation of lockdowns particularly given the absence of COVID in our community.

The talks follow a failed lunchtime meeting between Northern Irish politicians Peter Robinson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, and Martin  McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister.\\n The meeting between Robinson—who recently stood down as First Minister temporarily due to a sexual and financial and scandal concerning his wife Iris—and McGuinness lasted less than one hour. This prompted Brown and Cowen, who had been discussing similar issues in London, to make an unscheduled trip to Ulster in an attempt to attempt to prevent the collapse of the Irish political system due to a conflict about the DUP\\'s refusal to transfer the Irish policing and justice system from London to Belfast. On his way to the failed meeting, McGuinness said that he was \"frustrated\" that Sinn Féin had been stalling for time by waiting three years for the devolution of power.\\n Sinn Féin—a political party promoting an independent Ireland—called the meeting, before it occurred, a defining moment in the crisis. The DUP says that there is insufficient public confidence for the powers to  be transferred, and claims that a date for the transfer was never set. It also demands that, before any transfer attempts begin, the Parades  Commission—which is responsible for the conditions of a number of contentious marches—be disbanded. Sinn Féin responds to this by accusing the DUP of giving the organisers of the parades, the loyalist Orange Order, a veto. The Orange Order organises parades and rallies in support of Ireland being a part of the United Kingdom.\\n Brown and Cowen are both confident that the issues are resolvable. Before departing, Brown said \"We believe that the problems  that exist in devolving policing and justice are all soluble problems.

      "{'published': 'Tuesday, December 25, 2007', 'scraped_at': 1653231326.4369779, 'content': 'International leaders have issued Christmas time messages:\\n In his first Christmas address as Australia\\'s Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd called on his nation to drive safely during the holiday season, noting that his father was killed in a vehicle collision in the late 1960s. Rudd also commended the nation\\'s charities for helping the less fortunate, and Australian troops serving abroad.\\n Sources\\n As Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham\\'s extended Christmas greetings, he noted various challenges such as the economic downturn on Grand Bahama island and the heavy rainfall damage sustained in some regions in October and November. The nation prepares to celebrate its Junkanoo festival on Wednesday.\\n Sources\\n The Christmas and New Year\\'s address of Belgium\\'s King Albert called for national harmony among the national cultures, chiefly the Flemish and Walloon groups. This follows a year in which a national government could not be assembled for many months since elections in June.\\n Sources\\n Prime Minister Stephen Harper\\'s Christmas message paid tribute to the nation\\'s generous spirit whose \"purest expression today is the Canadian mission in Afghanistan, where our soldiers, diplomats and aid workers are, at great cost to themselves helping the Afghan people rebuild their shattered country.\" He noted the significant anniversaries to come in 2008 such as the 150 years since the founding of British Columbia colony and the 400 years since Quebec City was created by Samuel de Champlain.\\n Some controversy arose as the Prime Minister\\'s greeting omitted the Islamic Eid-ul-Adha observance, while including Hanukkah and Christmas.\\n Sources\\n Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of Liberia, noted progress in the country\\'s labour and economic situations during her Christmas address.\\n Sources\\n From the Philippines, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\\'s \\'s Christmas message included a tribute to the nation\\'s 8 million overseas workers, extending gratitude to their host nations.\\n Sources\\n Turkish President Abdullah Gül issued a Christmas message on Monday expressing wishes for unity and tolerance in the nation. Although Turkey is a largely Islamic nation, the President indicated its Christian citizens were \"equal members of the Turkish nation\".\\n Sources\\n American President George Bush\\'s brief Christmas statement began with a passage from the Gospel of Luke foretelling the Nativity of Jesus, then gave \"thanks for Christ\\'s message of love and mercy\" while remembering the nation\\'s \"responsibility to serve\".\\n Sources\\n Queen Elizabeth\\'s annual Christmas message began and ended footage from her 1957 Christmas address, the first message from a British Monarch to be televised. Her 2007 address mentioned family, the work of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the need for charity. A recently-introduced royal YouTube channel also presented the Queen\\'s Christmas message for Internet viewers.\\n Sources\\n Pope Benedict delivered his Christmas \"Urbi et orbi\" to many thousands at Saint Peter\\'s Square in Vatican City after celebrating the traditional Christmas Midnight Mass service. The pontiff remembered the world\\'s war-torn regions including Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans, calling for the light of Christ to \"shine forth and bring consolation to those who live in the darkness of poverty, injustice and war.\" He decried the various injustices and conflicts, noting these \"are destroying the internal fabric of many countries and embittering international relations.\"\\n Sources\\n', 'type': 'reliable', 'domain': 'https://en.wikinews.org/', 'url': 'https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Leaders_throughout_the_world_deliver_Christmas_messages', 'title': 'Leaders throughout the world deliver Christmas messages'}\n",

    "Requests is a library we use to make requests for HTML on wikinews articles. When then use Beautifulsoup (bs4) to parse the HTML for the information we need. We place the data in a pandas dataframe so we can write it to a csv file. The biggest challenge of the scrape was that certain news articles such as briefs had a structure different from other articles making it difficult to generalise our code. As briefs are a small collection of different articles we ended up sorting these from the articles links we got with the request library. Otherwise we didn't really have any challenges. "
